## HAPPY HOUR 

### FRONT END REPO!   
As of August 2021 this Repo currently contains only the Front End code of the Happy Hour application. Rails Backend code here --> https://github.com/zoeblairfriedman/happy-hour-react 

### CORS Extension
Currently you will need a CORS Changer extension to conduct necessary Google API searches. We recommend: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc

### Terrible Practice
As of now we are all sharing my API key. This is a terrible practice and is on my length ToDo list to remedy.

### Setup Rails Backend
Install the gems required by the application by running 'bundle install'
CD into the backend folder 'happy-hour-react-backend'
Migrate all tables and create the database by running 'rails db:migrate'
Seed the database by running 'rails db:seed'

#### Start Backend Server
Start the server by running 'rails s'

#### Launch the front end 
Install all necessary packages by running 'npm install'

#### Start Frontend Server
Start the server by running 'npm start'
You will likely need to type "Y" to run the frontend on a different server

#### Enjoy Happy Hour!
    - Search for validated happy hours in your desired area
    - Use Google's API to add new Happy Hours
